# Safe Gaussian Distributed Soft Actor-Critic (SGDSAC) Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

## Introduce

We have proposed a novel distributed DRL algorithm called safe Gaussian distributed soft actor-critic (SGDSAC). Additionally, to facilitate the training of DRL-based energy management strategies for HEVs using Python and Simulink, we have provided a DLL-based DRL environment configuration solution.
We make our approach openly available here to facilitate the reviewers' evaluation of our work.
